\title{Create Taxonomy Annotation File}
\usage{
create_tax_merged(merged_table, annotation_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{merged_table}{A data frame containing taxonomic data. It must have columns \code{taxa} and \code{effect_sign}.}

\item{annotation_file}{A character string specifying the path to the output annotation file.}
}
\description{
This function generates an annotation file for a taxonomy tree based on a merged table of taxonomic data. It assigns colors to taxa based on the effect sign and writes various annotations to the specified file.
}
\details{
The function first assigns colors to the taxa based on their \code{effect_sign} values: "red" for positive effects and "blue" for negative effects. It then writes general annotation settings to the specified annotation file. For each taxon in the merged table, if the taxon is not "unknown" and does not contain "uncultured", the function writes detailed annotations to the file, including marker size, color, rotation, background color, and font size.
}
\examples{
# Example data frame
merged_table <- data.frame(
  taxa = c("Genus1", "uncultured_bacteria", "Genus2", "unknown", "uncultured_fungus", "Family1"),
  effect_sign = c("positive", "negative", "positive", "negative", "negative", "positive")
)
# Define the annotation file path
annotation_file <- "taxonomy_annotations.txt"
# Call the function
create_tax_merged(merged_table, annotation_file)
}
